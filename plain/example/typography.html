					<p>A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, ‚Äúto write beside‚Äù or ‚Äúwritten beside‚Äù) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a <span class="_textRainbowAnimated">particular</span> point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
					<!-- <p>I'm talking about really serious issues right here. I heard someone just saying "The quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog" and something like "Pijamalƒ± hasta yaƒüƒ±z ≈üof√∂re √ßabucak g√ºvendi." It was ridiculous and unbelievable! </p>-->
					<p>I'm talking about really serious issues.</p>
					<h1>Really long header this time, and I still trying get this overflow it. Don't mind me I'm just enlarging it for no reason</h1>
					<p>I believe you're right!</p>
					<h2>And second time this is a little bit smaller but still big.</h2>
					<h2>And second time this is a little bit smaller but still big, and I still trying get this overflow it. Don't mind me I'm just enlarging it for no reason</h2>
					<p>Also I agree with this one!</p>

					<h3>But this is just keeps in the middle, and I still trying get this overflow it. Don't mind me I'm just enlarging it for no reason</h3>

					<p>This is a paragraph. And this is <var>variable</var> inside paragraph. Is there any difference in the line size? If not, then let's continue with <figcaption>caption of figure</figcaption>
					<p><a href=#!>This is a text link</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Strong is used to indicate strong importance.</strong></p>
					<p><em>This text has added emphasis.</em></p>
					<p>The <b>b element</b> is stylistically different text from normal text, without any special importance.</p>
					<p>The <i>i element</i> is text that is offset from the normal text.</p>
					<p>The <u>u element</u> is text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation.</p>
					<p><del>This text is deleted</del> and <ins>This text is inserted</ins>.</p>
					<p><s>This text has a strikethrough</s>.</p>
					<p>Superscript<sup>¬Æ</sup>.</p>
					<p>Subscript for things like H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
					<p><small>This small text is small for fine print, etc.</small></p>
					<p>Abbreviation: <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></p>
					<p><q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/q">This text is a short inline quotation.</q></p>
					<p><cite>This is a citation.</cite></p>
					<p>The <dfn>dfn element</dfn> indicates a definition.</p>
					<p>The <mark>mark element</mark> indicates a highlight.</p>

					<h3>Utility Classes for Texts</h3>
					<p>This is a test that includes various text styles like <span class=u-txtStroke>extra 1px stroke</span> (<code>u-txtStroke</code>) to make texts artificially bold and <span class="u-txtOnImg">stuff with also fixed fill and stroke color</span> (<code>u-txtOnImg</code>) so you can use this to make text readable on any color or image in both themes.</p>
					<p>You can color inline texts whatever you want. <span class=u-txtRed>Tomato soup</span> (<code>u-txtRed</code>), <span class=u-txtYellow>lemonade</span> (<code>u-txtYellow</code>), <span class=u-txtOrange>orange juice</span> (<code>u-txtOrange</code>), <span class=u-txtGreen>green soda</span> (<code>u-txtGreen</code>), <span class=u-txtBlue>blueberry</span> (<code>u-txtBlue</code>), <span class=u-txtCyan>cyanide</span> (<code>u-txtCyan</code>) even <span class=u-txtRainbowAnimated>a pony</span> (<code>u-txtRainbowAnimated</code>) etc.
					<h3 class=u-txtRainbowAnimated>This is a huge text with animated rainbow fill inside.</h3>
					<h1 class=u-txtBulky>This is bulky text and looks great in headings!</h1>
