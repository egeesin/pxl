					<p><strong>A person who doesn't</strong> make <em>any mistake</em> is <code>a person</code> who doesn't do anything. And biggest mistake in the world is to thought you're perfect.</p>
					<p>I think we really should give a crap to these idioms, especially when I type meaningless paragraphs like these, I see a reason to explain <a href="//google.com">this</a> sometimes. Thanks to me, I stretched my fingers a little and I am typing really something random things right now instead of being too lazy to copy-paste from Lorem Ipsum generators. Probably, this is should be longest sentence of the existence. I can't understand but that's really is.</p>
