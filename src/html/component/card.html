			<p>This paragraph is nested inside an article. It contains many different, sometimes useful, <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/tags/>HTML5 tags</a>. Of course there are classics like <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and <small>small</small>        but there are many others as well. Hover the following text for abbreviation tag: <abbr title="abbreviation">abbr</abbr>. You can define <del>deleted text</del> which often gets replaced with <ins>inserted</ins> text.
			<p>You can also use <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which sometimes is styled similarly to the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> or <samp>samp</samp> tags. Even more specifically, there is a tag just for <var>variables</var>. Not to be mistaken with blockquotes
			below, the quote tag lets you denote something as <q>quoted text</q>. Lastly don't forget the sub (H<sub>2</sub>O) and sup (E = MC<sup>2</sup>) tags.

**A person who doesn't** make *any mistake* is ``a person`` who doesn't do anything. And biggest mistake in the world is to thought you're perfect.

I think we really should give a crap to these idioms, especially when I type meaningless paragraphs like these, I see a reason to explain [this](//google.com) sometimes. Thanks to me, I stretched my fingers a little and I am typing really something random things right now instead of being too lazy to copy-paste from Lorem Ipsum generators. Probably, this is should be longest sentence of the existence. I can't understand but that's really is.
