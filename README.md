## Build

**Note:** Instructions tested on GNU/Linux distros and macOS.

**Dependencies:** [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start)

Open a terminal emulator and execute commands below:

```sh
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/egeesin/pxl

# Change directory
cd pxl

# Install Gulp plugins to local directory.
npm i

# Generate
gulp build

# Open in your test browser
gulp watch # or just gulp
```

### Browser Support

All modern browsers released last 2 years are supported. Supporting legacy browsers isn't main focus yet. For details, check `browserslist` section in `package.json`.

### Concepts & The Design

(To be documented‚Ä¶)

### Methodology/Class Namings

It's based on a combination of [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/), [OOCSS](https://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css), [BEVM](https://webuild.envato.com/blog/chainable-bem-modifiers/) and [Harry Roberts' namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/).

In this theme, intention is to combine a few of naming conventions to improve legibility and maintainability. Word groups are written with `camelCase` instead of comma-separated in order to not confused between seperation of `block-element-modifier` and word group.

Modifier and variant classes are separated from block and element classes. If you familiar with UNIX command line this will probably help.

```
// üëé
block block--modifier
	block__element block__element--modifier

// üëç
block --modifier
	block__element --modifier
block -variant
```

To connect modifier with a block(in CSS): ``.block.-modifier``

### Typography
Almost all box units are (r)em-based. Heading elements are proportionally sized by modular scale and each typographic element margin resized to fit vertical rhythm. Thanks to CSS custom properties, everything is reconfigurable. Default font-family is Inter V (patched version of Iosevka as default monospace font) and fallback is system font stack.

### Media Breakpoints
Breakpoints in the media queries based on [human ergonomics](https://twitter.com/lukew/status/273453112902172672).

## Known Issues
- Undocumented combinations of variants or modifiers may not look perfect.
- Contrast value between different color palettes may differ, need further adjustment to match their counterparts.
- Anchor text underline animates on hover except Chrome or any other Chromium based web browsers.
